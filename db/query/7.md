# Velox中Task、Pipeline、Driver、PlanNode、Operator概念
# Task
```
Task is responsible for converting a query plan into a set of pipelines consisting of multiple operators stacked on top of each other.
```

```
Task is responsible for maintaining shared state and enabling coordination between operators. The shared state consists of:
- Splits
- Join bridges and barriers
- Exchange clients
- Local exchange queues
- Local merge sources
- Merge join sources

Each piece of shared state is associated with a particular plan node. Operators use plan node IDs when accessing shared state.
Custom operators have access to splits and barriers. Other pieces of shared state are not available to custom operators.
```


# Pipeline
```
Velox query plan is a tree of PlanNode’s. Each PlanNode has zero or more child PlanNode’s.
To execute a query plan, Velox converts it into a set of pipelines.
Each pipeline is made of a linear sequence of operators that corresponds to a linear sub-tree of the plan.
The plan tree is broken down into a set of linear sub-trees by disconnecting all but one child node from each node that has two or more children.
```
Pipeline是通过对于拥有多个节点的算子进行切分，使得切分后只有一个孩子节点，其余的孩子节点构成其他的Pipeline。

# Driver
Driver就是执行一个pipline的单一线程。

# PlanNode和Operator
PlanNode和Operator大多数情况下是一一对应的关系，但是对于Join Operator来说，会产生两个PlanNode，分别是Join Probe Node、Join Build Node，通过Join Bridge连接，Join Bridge可以理解为C++里面的Future结构，当Join Build Node完成之后，会通过Join Bridge把HashTable传递给Join Probe Node。
